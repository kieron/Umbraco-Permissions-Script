# Umbraco Permissions Script

The script takes 1 optional argument, which is a folder name, located in the directory defined in the variables portion of the script, ie `.\perms.ps1 "testSite"`

Alternatively, if you provide no arguments, the script will use one of three methods, again defined in the variables portion of the script.
